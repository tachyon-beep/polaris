# Legacy/Unused Graph Components

This directory contains unused or deprecated implementations that were part of early development but are no longer part of the active codebase.

## Files

- composite_graph.py - Unused composite graph implementation
- delta_tracking.py - Unused delta tracking implementation
- middleware.py - Unused middleware system
- streaming_metrics.py - Unused streaming metrics implementation
- validation.py - Old validation system (replaced by utils/validation)

## Status

These files are not used anywhere in the codebase and have been moved here for reference. They represent experimental features or approaches that were ultimately not needed.

## Note

This is different from the active graph operations in:
- /core/graph_components.py
- /core/graph_metrics.py
- /core/graph_subgraphs.py
- /core/graph_traversal.py

Which are still actively used and tested in the codebase.
